Genomic sequencing has significantly improved our understanding of cancer. By allowing scientists to read the full DNA sequence of a tumor, they can identify the mutations within it. This technology shows us how many mutations are present and the ones that matter for how the cancer behaves

One common type of mutation found in tumors is a SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism). A SNP is a tiny change in just one “letter” of DNA. While most are harmless, some can influence how a gene works and can play a role in the development of cancer. Sequencing helps researchers separate these meaningful mutations from the other stuff.

Another important idea we’ve learned from sequencing is the difference between passenger mutations and driver genes. Driver genes are the specific mutations that actually push a cell toward becoming cancerous by giving it a growth advantage or helping it survive when it shouldn’t. These are the mutations that matter in cancer development.

Some driver genes turn into what are known as oncogenes. Oncogenes are normal genes that become dangerous when mutated. It forces the cell to grow and divide uncontrollably. Identifying oncogenes in a tumor can help when it comes to specific targeted treatments.

Overall, genomic sequencing has shown that every tumor has its own unique combination of mutations and that tumors continue to change over time. This information helps doctors better understand how a cancer formed, why it behaves the way it does, and which treatments are likely to be most effective.
