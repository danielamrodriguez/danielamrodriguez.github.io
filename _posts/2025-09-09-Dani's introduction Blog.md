## Dani's Introduction Blog

Hi! I'm Daniela Rodriguez but you can call me Dani.
I'm a public health major and a part of the class of 2029.
My main goal in life is just to help people and be happy yet true to myself. 
Usually during my free time I like to journal and play piano.
My favorite subject in college so far has been Racial/Ethnic minorities.
